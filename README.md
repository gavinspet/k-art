# E-commerce website named "K-art"

Hi! My name is **Kartick Kumar Ghosh**, I have created this MERN Stack application named **K-art**

# About this project

DevelopedÂ a web application using the **MERN stack** for independent artists and creators.
Customers will be able to purchase goods from independent artists and creators using this web application. Helping independent producers and artists, promoting art, and providing them with a platform where they can get attention, notoriety, and financial compensation are the main objectives.

# Basic Agenda 

This e-commerce website's main goal is to connect with independent artists and producers and display their goods. For every transaction, we will receive a commission; there are no additional fees involved. The major goals are to help independent producers and artists, promote art, and give them a platform where they may get visibility, fame, and financial reward.
